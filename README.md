## FAQ
### Is it free?
Yes. But captcha recognition service is required and its not free.

### What CAPTCHA_ZERO_BALANCE error means and why captcha service is required?
Riot signup service is protected with captcha so captcha recognition service is required for creation. CAPTCHA_ZERO_BALANCE means you dont have enough money on your captcha balance.

### What RATE_LIMITED error means?
You can create only 10 accounts at once from 1 ip. If you need more use proxies.

### I'm using free proxies and have a bad success creation rate, why?
Free proxies are super unstable. I highly recommend paid ones like [IpRoyal](https://iproyal.com?r=megaded) and [ProxyCheap](https://app.proxy-cheap.com/r/0TMQxQ). Or you can use your own ofc. I recommend rotating proxies, on proxy list generation use 1 specific country please and if you want to know creation ip use session(sticky ip) option. Use at least 1 different proxy for 5 accounts to not be rate limited.

### VN accounts are not created properly. What should I do?
You should have Vietnam ip to create VN accounts.
